#### Key Development Patterns

**Data Flow:**
1. **API Calls** → Shared services (`shared/services/api.js`)
2. **State Management** → Redux Toolkit slices (`shared/store/slices/`)
3. **Real-time Updates** → Socket.io integration
4. **Error Handling** → Centralized in services with retry logic

**Code Generation Best Practices:**
- **Always use TypeScript-like JSDoc** for function parameters and return types
- **Implement proper error boundaries** around complex components
- **Use String() conversion** for any text that might be an object
- **Apply optional chaining (?.)** for all nested property access
- **Convert numbers explicitly** with `Number(value) || 0`
- **Check arrays exist** before calling `.map()`, `.filter()`, etc.
- **Sanitize Redux state** to remove Mongoose virtual properties

#### Common Issues & Solutions

**🔧 Cache Issues (Development)**
```javascript
// Always use these settings in development:
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 0,        // Always fetch fresh data
      cacheTime: 1000,     // Clear cache quickly
      refetchOnWindowFocus: true
    }
  }
});
```

**🔧 Object Rendering Errors**
```javascript
// NEVER do this:
{auction}                    // ❌ Renders entire object
{auction.currentTeam}        // ❌ If currentTeam is an object

// ALWAYS do this:
{String(auction?.status || 'unknown')}  // ✅ Safe string conversion
{auction.currentTeam?.name || 'Unknown'} // ✅ Safe property access
```

**🔧 Redux State Sanitization**
```javascript
// Remove Mongoose virtual properties before storing in Redux
const sanitizeAuction = (auction) => ({
  ...auction,
  // Remove virtual properties that cause React errors
  progress: undefined,
  remainingTeams: undefined,
  activeParticipants: undefined,
  timeRemaining: undefined,
  // Ensure proper data types
  currentBid: Number(auction.currentBid) || 0,
  status: String(auction.status || 'unknown')
});
```

**🔧 Socket Connection Issues**
```javascript
// Use environment-aware socket configuration
const socket = io(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? window.location.origin
  : 'http://localhost:5000'
);
```

#### Development Workflow

**🚀 Starting Fresh Development:**
```bash
# 1. Clear all caches
cd web && npm run clear-cache

# 2. Start with fresh state
npm run start:fresh

# 3. Use incognito mode for testing
# Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)
```

**🐛 Debugging Object Errors:**
1. **Check Redux DevTools** for object properties in state
2. **Add console logging** to identify object structure:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Object type:', typeof value);
   console.log('Object keys:', Object.keys(value || {}));
   ```
3. **Wrap suspicious values** with `String()` conversion
4. **Use Error Boundaries** to isolate rendering issues

**🔄 Cache Troubleshooting:**
- **Service workers disabled** in development (localhost)
- **React Query uses minimal caching** in development
- **No-cache headers** on all API requests in development
- **Use incognito mode** for guaranteed fresh state

#### Component Development Guidelines

**Creating New Components:**
1. **Always add Error Boundaries** around complex components
2. **Use proper TypeScript-like prop validation**
3. **Implement loading states** for async operations
4. **Add accessibility attributes** (aria-label, alt, etc.)
5. **Test with malformed data** to ensure safety

**State Management:**
1. **Use Redux Toolkit** for global state
2. **Create selectors** with `createSelector` for performance
3. **Sanitize API responses** before storing in Redux
4. **Handle loading/error states** consistently

**API Integration:**
1. **Use shared API service** for all HTTP requests
2. **Implement retry logic** for failed requests
3. **Handle authentication errors** globally
4. **Validate response data** before using in components

#### Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Test in incognito mode (fresh cache)
- [ ] Test with slow network conditions
- [ ] Test with malformed API responses
- [ ] Test authentication flows thoroughly
- [ ] Test real-time features (Socket.io)
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test PWA functionality

**Common Test Scenarios:**
1. **League Creation** → Auction start → Member joining
2. **Real-time bidding** with multiple users
3. **Network interruptions** during auctions
4. **Cache clearing** and state recovery
5. **Authentication** token expiration

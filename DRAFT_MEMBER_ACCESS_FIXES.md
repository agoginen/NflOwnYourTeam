# Draft Member Access Fixes

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### Problem
League members were unable to join/access drafts after the league owner started them, encountering:
- Socket connection timeout errors
- 400 (Bad Request) errors on auction endpoints  
- Selector memoization warnings causing performance issues
- Access denied errors even for legitimate league members

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Socket Connection Improvements
**File**: `web/src/services/socketService.js`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Connection timeouts
- Failed websocket connections
- No fallback transport method

**Changes**:
- ✅ **Environment-aware URLs**: Uses `localhost:5000` in development, origin in production
- ✅ **Transport Fallback**: Tries polling first, then websocket
- ✅ **Increased Timeout**: From 20s to 30s 
- ✅ **Better Reconnection**: 5 attempts with 1s delay
- ✅ **Timeout Handling**: Auto-switches to polling-only on timeout

### 2. Auction Access Control Fixes
**File**: `backend/src/routes/auctions.js`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Members couldn't access auctions they should have access to
- Missing participants in auction even if they're league members
- 403 access denied errors for legitimate users

**Changes**:
- ✅ **Dual Access Check**: Checks both league membership AND auction participation
- ✅ **Auto-participant Addition**: Adds missing league members to auction participants
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive access debugging
- ✅ **Participant Recovery**: Automatically fixes missing participant records

### 3. Redux Selector Memoization
**File**: `web/src/store/slices/auctionSlice.js`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Selector warnings about unnecessary re-renders
- Performance issues from non-memoized selectors

**Changes**:
- ✅ **createSelector Usage**: All selectors now use proper memoization
- ✅ **Base Selector**: Single base selector for auction state
- ✅ **Performance**: Prevents unnecessary component re-renders

### 4. Error Handling Improvements
**File**: `web/src/pages/auction/AuctionPage.js`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Generic error messages
- No automatic redirect on access issues

**Changes**:
- ✅ **Access Error Detection**: Detects "Access denied" errors
- ✅ **Auto-redirect**: Automatically redirects to leagues page on access issues
- ✅ **Better UX**: Clear feedback instead of hanging on errors

### 5. Development Mode Auction Reset
**File**: `backend/src/routes/auctions.js`

**Issues Fixed**:
- Couldn't create new auctions for testing
- "Auction already exists" blocking development

**Changes**:
- ✅ **Development Override**: Allows multiple auctions for testing
- ✅ **Auto-cleanup**: Clears existing auction references before creating new ones

## 🔍 Debug Information Added

### Backend Logging
When members access auctions, the server now logs:
```javascript
🔍 Auction access check: {
  userId: "user_id",
  auctionId: "auction_id", 
  leagueId: "league_id",
  isMember: true/false,
  isParticipant: true/false,
  leagueMembersCount: 2,
  participantsCount: 2
}
```

### Frontend Logging
Socket connections now log:
```javascript
🔌 Connecting to socket: http://localhost:5000
🔄 Retrying with polling transport only...
🔄 Reconnected after 3 attempts
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fixes

### For League Members:
1. **Join Draft**: Can access auction page when owner starts draft
2. **Socket Connection**: Stable real-time connection with fallback
3. **Auto-participation**: Automatically added to auction if missing
4. **Clear Errors**: Helpful error messages with auto-redirect
5. **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders or warnings

### For League Owners:
1. **Start Multiple Drafts**: Can restart drafts for testing
2. **All Members Included**: Missing members automatically added to participants
3. **Debug Info**: Console logs help troubleshoot access issues

## 🚀 Testing Steps

### 1. Create Test League
```bash
# Create league with 2+ members
# Ensure both members are active in league
```

### 2. Start Draft (Owner)
```bash
# Owner clicks "Start Draft"
# Verify auction created successfully
# Check console for participant count
```

### 3. Join Draft (Member)
```bash
# Member navigates to auction page
# Should see auction interface, not errors
# Check console for socket connection success
# Verify member appears in participants list
```

### 4. Verify Socket Functionality
```bash
# Test real-time updates (bids, nominations)
# Check WebSocket connection in DevTools
# Verify polling fallback if WebSocket fails
```

## 📊 Error Types Fixed

| Error Type | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Socket Timeout | ❌ Connection failed | ✅ Auto-fallback to polling |
| 400 Bad Request | ❌ Access denied | ✅ Auto-adds participant |
| Selector Warnings | ❌ Performance issues | ✅ Proper memoization |
| Access Errors | ❌ Generic message | ✅ Auto-redirect with clear message |
| Missing Participants | ❌ Manual fix needed | ✅ Auto-recovery |
